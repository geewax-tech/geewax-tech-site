# How to delete your WePass account

Inside the WePass app, choose "Settings" from the left side menu.

At the bottom of the screen, you'll see an item called "Delete account data".

If you click this item, it will prompt you to confirm whether you'd like to delete all of your account data. Confirming will remove all account data.
